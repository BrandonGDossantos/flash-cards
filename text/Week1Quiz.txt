Chapter 1
Carbohydrates are 
organic molecules 
Adult humans must consume a minimum of __ different amino acids on a regular basis
8
A healthy human requires how many essential amino acids 
8
Glycerol plus three fatty acids form a triglyceride molecule
True
Two common forms of plant polysaccharide are 
starch and fiber
The body can obtain more energy from protein than it can from an equal amount of lipids 
False 
Shifting an amino group from a donor amino acid to a keto acid is called 
Transamination 
Dietary fiber is a form of protein
False  
Disaccharides are __
Double Sugars
Which one of the following criteria is present in metabolic syndrome?
Hypertension
A well-nourished 80-kg person stores approximately  __ g of carbohydrates
500 g
Exogenous cholesterol refers to cholesterol produced by the body
False, Endogenous
Four gram of lipid contain approximately __ kcal
36
Fructose is the sweetest of simple sugar
True
Glucose, a hexose sugar, contains five carbon atoms in its molecular structure
False, 6 carbon
Water-soluble fiber lowers LDL cholesterol
True
The disaccharide sucrose forms from __
Glucose + Fructose, sucrose: the most common dietary disaccharide; consists of equal parts of glucose and fructose. 
The term complex carbohydrate commonly refers to
Dietary starch
Dietary fibers that show a cholesterol lowering effect are
Classified as water soluble, in contrast, the water-insoluble fibers—the fiber contained in whole-wheat–containing products, cabbage, beets, cauliflower, turnips, and apple skin, which absorb large amounts of water—of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and cellulose-rich wheat bran failed to lower cholesterol.
One of the benefits of a high-fiber diet is that these foods typically replace high-carbohydrate foods
False
Incomplete proteins are higher quality proteins and contain all essential amino acids
False, an incomplete protein, or lower quality protein, lacks one or more essential amino acid. Incomplete protein diets eventually lead to protein malnutrition. This occurs whether or not the food sources contain adequate energy or protein quantity.
Proteins play a role in regulating acid-base quality in body fluids
True
Regularly consuming fish and fish oil improves one’s blood lipid profile and reduces overall heart disease risk, particularly for sudden death. 
True
Excessive ketone formation increases body fluid acidity, a condition known as
ketosis
The term “lipid” represents a heterogeneous group of compounds including all of the following except:
meats
Deamination describes the transfer of an amino group to a non-nitrogen-containing carbon compound
False
__ contains the largest reserves of glycogen
Muscle, the largest reserve (approximately 400 g) exists as muscle glycogen, 90 to 110 g as liver glycogen (highest concentration that represents 3 to 7% of the liver’s weight), and only about 2 to 3 g as blood glucose. 
An amino group shifts from a donor amino acid to an acceptor acid and the acceptor becomes a new amino acid in a process called ___
Transamination
The “insulin antagonist” hormone is called ___
Glucagon
__ makes margarine solid at room temperature.
Hydrogenation
During high-intensity exercise, what serves as the primary source of fuel?
Carbohydrates
Amino acids that are created by the body are classified as ___
Nonessential, the term nonessential does not mean they are unimportant; rather, they must be synthesized from other compounds already in the body at a rate to meet demands for normal growth and tissue repair. F
Fat constitutes the ideal cellular fuel because each molecule carries large quantities of ___
energy per unit weight
During prolonged exercise, the alanine glucose cycle generates between __% and __% of the total exercise energy requirement
10,15
What results when the pancreas cannot produce sufficient insulin to regulate blood glucose?
type 2 diabetes
Elevated blood glucose levels cause the beta cells of the pancreas to secrete the hormone
insulin
The RDA represents __
a standard for nutrient intake expressed as a daily average
An amino acid’s characteristics are determined by its biologic value
False
Carbohydrates contain more energy per unit weight than lipids
False
